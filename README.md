# Diagenesis-model
Numerical model on fluid-rock interaction in carbonate rocks (Ahm et al. 2018)

Building on published modeling efforts (Banner & Hanson, 1990; Blattler & Higgind, 2015; Fantle & Higgins, 2014), we here present a numerical model that simulates early marine diagenesis of carbonate sediments by stoichiometrically recrystallizing aragonite to low-Mg calcite (neomorphism) or aragonite/calcite to dolomite (dolomitization) assuming conservation of mass of carbon in the sediment. For a detailed description of the model setup we refer to Ahm et al. 2018 (GCA Vol. X, No. X, pp).
